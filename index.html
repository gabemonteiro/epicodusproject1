            <h2>About</h2>
              Hey there! My name is Gabe Monteiro and I have recently rekindled my HTML hobby in hopes to turn this into my full time career. I have always had a passion for computers and technology. When going back to school I battled getting a Computer Science degree or a Criminal Justice degree. I eventually settled on Criminal Justice and ultimately wished I would have gone into Computer Science. With my basic experience I have done various projects for myself and family in the field of web development. Currently I am working full time in sales while attending the part-time program at Epicodus. My ultimate goal would be to complete the full-time program and go into a career relevant in the field of development. If im not working or in class I am:
